# a2-eda

In this assignment, you will work with one of the three datasets of interest you have chosen, and perform an exploratory analysis to better understand the shape & structure of the data, investigate initial questions, and develop preliminary insights & hypotheses.

Your final submission will take the form of a report consisting of captioned visualizations that convey key insights gained during your analysis.

Step 1: Data Selection
You've already picked three datasets that reflect a topic area of interest to you. To streamline this assignment and as a fallback, there are a number of pre-selected datasets included below for you to choose from if you prefer to use those instead, or if you run into serious trouble with data formats (too big, too small, too broken, etc).

If you are concerned that your self-selected dataset may not work, you are free to check with Kevin or I to ensure it is appropriate for the course. Data collection and preparation (also known as data wrangling) can be a very tedious and time-consuming process. Be sure you have sufficient time to conduct exploratory analysis, after preparing the data.

After selecting a topic and dataset – but prior to analysis – you should write down an initial set of at least three questions you'd like to investigate.

Part 2: Exploratory Visual Analysis
You will perform an exploratory analysis of your dataset using browser based tools including D3, vega-lite, React, and SVG. You should consider two different phases of exploration.

In the first phase, you should seek to gain an overview of the shape & structure of your dataset. What variables does the dataset contain? How are they distributed? Are there any notable data quality issues? Are there any surprising relationships among the variables? Be sure to also perform "sanity checks" for patterns you expect to see!

In the second phase, you should investigate your initial questions, as well as any new questions that arise during your exploration. For each question, start by creating a visualization that might provide a useful answer. Then refine the visualization (by adding additional variables, changing sorting or axis scales, filtering or subsetting data, etc.) to develop better perspectives, explore unexpected observations, or sanity check your assumptions. You should repeat this process for each of your questions, but feel free to revise your questions or branch off to explore new questions if the data warrants.

Final Deliverable
Your final submission should take the form of a sequence of data visualization graphics on a web page – similar to a slide show or comic book – that consists of 8 or more visualizations detailing your most important insights. Your "insights" can include important surprises or issues (such as data quality problems affecting your analysis) as well as responses to your analysis questions. You do not necessarily need to create 8 unique visualizations: you may repeat the same visualization with various captions highlighting different parts of the data, but your submission must include a minimum of 4 unique views of the data.

Each visualization should be accompanied by a title and descriptive caption highlighting the insight(s) shown in that view, which correspond to an aspect of the visualization which is made prominent in some way. Provide sufficient detail such that anyone could read through your report and understand what you've learned without necessarily being familiar with that dataset. You should caption your visualizations to draw attention to specific features of the data. You must use the expressiveness of the SVG medium to call attention to the aspect of the visualization you are captioning. Examples of this will be provided in lecture.

When complete, submit a url to the page with your visualizations. You should also include a brief write-up (4 paragraphs max.) stating the questions you came up with, explaining your analysis process and outlining the data transformations that you performed in the course of creating the visualizations. The end of the write up should include a brief summary of main lessons learned.

Data Wrangling Tools
The data you choose may require reformatting, transformation or cleaning prior to visualization. Here are tools you can use for data preparation. We recommend first trying to import and process your data in the same tool you intend to use for visualization. If that fails, pick the most appropriate option among the tools below. Contact the course staff if you are unsure what might be the best option for your data!

Graphical Tools
Tableau (Links to an external site.) - Tableau provides basic facilities for data import, transformation & blending.
Trifacta Wrangler (Links to an external site.) - Interactive tool for data transformation & visual profiling.
OpenRefine (Links to an external site.) - A free, open source tool for working with messy data.
Programming Tools
JavaScript data utilities (Links to an external site.) and/or the Datalib JS library (Links to an external site.).
Pandas (Links to an external site.) - Data table and manipulation utilites for Python.
Grading Criteria
Each submission will be graded based on both the analysis process and included visualizations. Here are our grading criteria:

Poses clear questions applicable to the chosen dataset.
Appropriate data quality assessment and transformation.
Sufficient breadth of analysis, exploring multiple questions.
Sufficient depth of analysis, with appropriate follow-up questions.
Expressive & effective visualizations crafted to investigate analysis questions.
Clearly written, understandable annotations that communicate primary insights.
Submission Details
This is an individual assignment. You may not work in groups.

When complete, submit a url to your page hosted on GitHub pages. The images filenames should be numbered in the order that they are meant to be viewed, e.g. 1.png, 2.png, 3.png, .... You should also include a brief write-up (4 paragraphs max.) stating the questions you came up with, explaining your analysis process and outlining the data transformations that you performed in the course of creating the visualizations. The end of the write up should include a brief summary of main lessons learned.

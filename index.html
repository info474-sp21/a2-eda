    <h1>Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>
    <h2>The Dataset</h2>
    <p>The dataset I have selected is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey/data" target="_blank">Mental
            Health in Tech dataset</a> from Kaggle. The dataset
        contains information about respondents, their employers, and as well as their answers to a survey on mental
        health in the tech workplace. I hope to use this dataset to try to understand
        the attitudes towards mental health in the tech workplace.</p>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>How does mental health interfere with people's work by age?</li>
        <!-- <li>Which country has the most respondents?</li> -->
        <li>Does age play a role in whether people seek treatment for a mental health condition?</li>
        <!-- - seek treatment, by age -->
        </li>
        <li>How do attitudes towards mental health differ from physical health?</li>
        <!-- mentalhealthconsequence, physhealthconsequence, mentalhealthinterview, physhealthinterview, mentalvsphysical -->
        <!-- <li>Do employers take mental health as seriously as physical health?</li> -->
        <li>Do employers provide employees with enough resources regarding mental health?</li>
        <!-- - wellness_program, seek_help, benefits? -->
        <!-- <li>How easy is it for people to take medical leave for mental health?</li>
        <li>Are employers with more employees more likely to provide mental health benefits than employers with fewer
            employees?</li> -->
        <li>Are people more likely to discuss a mental health issue with their coworkers or supervisors?</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Exploratory Visual Analysis</h2>
    <h3>Phase 1</h3>
    <p>The dataset contains 27 variables and 1,259 rows (records). Of the 27 variables, 22 of them are
        nominal/categorical. Because a majority of my variables are categorical/nominal, most of my viusalizations 
        will bar plots rather than scatter plots or line plots. One variable, Timestamp, is temporal. The Age and number of employees (no_employees)
        are the only two numerical variables. Two variables, Country and state, are geographical.
        The main variables I will be using to answer my questions are:
    <ul>
        <li>Age</li>
        <li>Country</li>
        <li>treatment (Respondent sought treatment for mental health condition?)</li>
        <li>no_employees (number of employees at organization)</li>
        <li>benefits (employer provides mental health benefits?)</li>
        <li>seek_help (employer provides resources to learn moer about mental health issues and how to seek help?)</li>
        <li>leave (how easy is it for you to take medical leave for a mental health condition)</li>
        <li>coworkers (Would respondent be willing to discuss a mental health issue with their coworkers?)</li>
        <li>supervisor (Would you be willing to discuss a mental health issue with their supervisor?)</li>
        <li>mentalvsphysical (Does respondent feel that their employer takes mental health as seriously as physical
            health?)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>How are variables distributed?</h3>
    <p>Visualization 1 - Distribution of Age</p>
    <div id="vis1"></div>
    <p>From the visualization, we can see that in the dataset, there is one record with someone who has an age of almost
        100,000,000,000. This is not possible, so I will need
        to filter out ages that are greater than 100.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Visualization 2 - Distribution of Age after filtering out ages over 100</p>
    <div id="vis2"></div>
    <p>From the visualization, we can see that in the dataset, there multiple records of people who have negative ages.
        This is also not possible, so I will need
        to filter out ages that are less than 0.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Visualization 3 - Distribution of Age after filtering out ages over 100 and ages less than 0</p>
    <div id="vis3"></div>
    <p>From the visualization, we can see that there is a bell curve shape, which indicates a relatively normal
        distribution of ages.
        The majority of respondents were between 20 to 40 years old, with 29 year olds being the most frequent
        respondent.</p>
    <p>Visualization 4 - Distribution of Work Interference</p>
    <div id="vis4"></div>
    <p>From the visualization, we see that there is an 'NA' response category, meaning that people did not have a mental 
        health condition. To view the distribution for work interference of a mental health condition, I will need to filter
        out the 'NA' responses. 
    </p>
    <p>Visualization 5 - Distribution of Work Interference after filtering out NA responses</p>
    <div id="vis5"></div>
    <p>From the visualization, we see that the most frequent response is that a mental health condition
        sometimes interferes with their work. Although the rest of the response categories are about
        half the frequency or less than the Sometimes catetgory, the frequency is somewhat similar among the
        rest of the options for Never, Rarely, and NA, with Often being the least frequent.</p>

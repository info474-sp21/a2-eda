    <h1>Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>
    <h2>The Dataset</h2>
    <p>The dataset I have selected is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey/data"
            target="_blank">Mental
            Health in Tech dataset</a> from Kaggle. The dataset
        contains information about respondents, their employers, as well as their answers to a survey on mental
        health in the tech workplace. I hope to use this dataset to try to understand
        the attitudes towards mental health in the tech workplace.</p>

    <h2>Phase 1: Understanding the Shape and Structure of the Dataset</h2>
    <p>The dataset contains 27 variables and 1,259 rows (records). Of the 27 variables, 22 of them are
        nominal/categorical. Because a majority of my variables are categorical/nominal, most of my visualizations
        will bar plots rather than scatter plots or line plots. One variable, Timestamp, is temporal. The Age and number
        of employees (no_employees)
        are the only two numerical variables. Two variables, Country and state, are geographical.
        The main variables I will be using to answer my questions are:
    <ul>
        <li>Age</li>
        <li>treatment: Respondent sought treatment for mental health condition</li>
        <li>work_interfere: If have a mental health condition, does it interfere with their work</li>
        <li>mental_vs_physical: Does respondent feel that their employer takes mental health as seriously as physical
            health</li>
        <li>mental_health_interview: Would respondent bring up a mental health issue with a potential employer in an
            interview</li>
        <li>phys_health_interview: Would respondent bring up a physical health issue with a potential employer in an
            interview</li>
        <li>mental_health_consequence: Do you think that discussing a mental health issue with your employer would have
            negative consequences</li>
        <li>phys_health_consequence: Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with your employer would have
            negative consequences?</li>
        <li>benefits: employer provides mental health benefits</li>
        <li>wellness_program: Has your employer ever discussed mental health as part of an employee wellness program
        </li>
        <li>seek_help: employer provides resources to learn more about mental health issues and how to seek help</li>
        <!-- <li>leave (how easy is it for you to take medical leave for a mental health condition)</li> -->
        <li>coworkers: Would respondent be willing to discuss a mental health issue with their coworkers</li>
        <li>supervisor: Would you be willing to discuss a mental health issue with their supervisor</li>

    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Visualizations 1 - 3: Understanding the distribution of the age variable and identifying data quality issues
    </h3>

    <p>Visualization 1 - Distribution of Age</p>
    <div id="vis1"></div>
    <p>From the visualization, we can see that in the dataset, there is one record with someone who has an age of almost
        100,000,000,000. This is not possible, so I will need
        to filter out ages that are greater than 100.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>Visualization 2 - Distribution of Age after filtering out ages over 100</p>
    <div id="vis2"></div>
    <p>From the visualization, we can see that in the dataset, there are multiple records of people who have negative
        ages.
        This is also not possible, so I will need
        to filter out ages that are both less than 0 and greater than 100.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>Visualization 3 - Distribution of Age after filtering out ages over 100 and ages less than 0</p>
    <div id="vis3"></div>
    <p>From the visualization, we can see that there is a bell curve shape, which indicates a relatively normal
        distribution of ages.
        The majority of respondents are between 20 to 40 years old, with 29 year olds being the most frequent
        respondent.</p>

    <br />
    <h3>Visualizations 4 - 5: Understanding the distribution of the work interference variable and identifying data
        quality issues</h3>
    <p>Visualization 4 - Distribution of Work Interference</p>
    <div id="vis4"></div>
    <p>From the visualization, we see that there is an 'NA' response category, which indicates that people did not have
        a mental
        health condition. I want to view how a mental health condition plays a role in work interference, so I will need
        to filter
        out the 'NA' responses.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Visualization 5 - Distribution of Work Interference after filtering out NA responses</p>
    <div id="vis5"></div>
    <p>From the visualization, we see that the most frequent response is that a mental health condition
        sometimes interferes with their work. Although the rest of the response categories are about
        half the frequency or less than the Sometimes catetgory, the frequency is somewhat similar among the
        rest of the options for Never, Rarely, and NA, with Often being the least frequent.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h2>Phase 2: Investigating the Initial Questions</h2>
    <h3>Visualizations 6 - 7: Q1 (How does age play a role in mental health?) </h3>
    <p>Visualization 6 - Work Interference of a Mental Health Condition by Age</p>
    <div id="vis6"></div>
    <p>To answer the first question, I wanted to see how age plays a role in work interference of a mental health
        condition.
        From the visualization, we clearly see that for a majority of people who are in the 20 to 40 binned age,
        a mental health condition most frequently interferes with their work sometimes, and there is a big
        gap between sometimes and the other categories (never, often , rarely). For people outside of the 20 to 40
        binned age, the gap between
        sometimes and the other categories is very tiny, which indicates that there is a difference in work interference
        of a mental health condition by age.
    </p>

    <br />
    <br />
    <p>Visualization 7 - Age Distribution of People who Did Seek Treatment and People who Did Not Seek Treatment for a Mental Health Issue</p>
    <div id="vis7"></div>
    <p>
        For this visualization, I wanted to see how age plays a role in whether people seek treatment for a mental
        health
        condition to help me answer the first question. Overall, the chart shows that more people sought treatment for 
        their mental health issue than those who did not because the line for the 'Yes' category is higher than the 'No' category.     
        The chart shows that far more people in the 20 and 40 age bins 
        sought treatment than those who did not seek treatment. This is indicated by the large gap between the two lines at the 20 and 40 age bins. 
        The frequency for those who did and did not seek treatment had smaller differences for people outside of the 20 and 40 age bins, due to the 
        gap between the two lines getting smaller. This indicates that the rate for which people sought treatment decreased more dramatically as 
        age increased.   
    </p>

    <p>Based on visualizations 7 and 8, we can see that age does play a role in mental health. To investigate the first
        question,
        I assessed mental health by using the work interference variable (If have a mental health condition, does it
        interfere with their work) and
        the
        treatment variable (whether respondents sought treatment for their mental health condition). I first compared
        the
        age variable by the work interference variable and then by the treatment variable. In both cases, we see that
        there
        are differences among the work interference variable and treatment variable by age, so we can conclude that age
        plays
        a role in mental health. Older people seek treatment for their mental health condition less frequently than
        younger people.
        Additionally, for people in their 20s to 40s, a mental health condition most frequently interferes with their
        work condition
        sometimes, while for other ages, a mental health condition sometimes and often interferes with their work
        condition.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h3>Visualizations 8 - 9: Q2 (How do attitudes towards mental health differ from physical health?)</h3>
    <p>Visualization 8 - Distribution of whether respondents feel their employer takes mental health as seriously as
        physical health</p>
    <div id="vis8"></div>
    <p>
        From the visualization, we can see that most respondents don't know whether their employer
        takes mental health as seriously as physical health. Those who do believe and don't believe
        that their employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health are pretty even.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p>Visualization 9 - First row of charts compare whether respondents would bring up a mental health issue compared
        to a physical
        health issue in an interview. Second row of charts compare whether respondents believe there would be negative
        consequences if discussing
        a mental health issue compared to a physical health issue with their employer.
    </p>
    <div id="vis9"></div>
    <p>
        From the first row of charts, we can see that the most frequent response to whether an employee would bring up a mental health
        issue in an interview is 'No'. However, when it comes to whether an employee would bring up a physical health issue
        in an interview, the most frequent response is 'Maybe'. This indicates that people are more likely to bring up a physical
        health issue in an interview than a mental health issue. Respondents are far less likely (more than twice less likely) to
        bring up a mental health issue in an interview compared to a physical health issue. 
        
        From the second row of charts, we can see that far more people feel that there
        will not be any negative consequences of bringing up a physical health issue with their employer compared to a
        mental health issue.
    </p>

    <p>
        Based on visualizations 8 and 9, we can see that there is a difference in how mental health and physical health
        are viewed.
        To investigate the second question and to assess the attitudes towards mental health and physical health, I
        first plotted a histogram
        of the mental vs physical variable, which measures whether respondents believe whether their employer
        takes mental health as seriously as physical health. From the results, we see that most people don't know
        whether
        their employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health. Of those who do know, the number of people
        who do believe their employers take mental health as seriously as physical health are about the same number of
        people
        who do not believe their employers take mental health as seriously as physical health. To continue investigating
        the second question,
        I used the variables: mental_health_interview, phys_health_interview, mental_health_consequence, and
        phys_health_consequence. In visualization 9,
        I plotted the mental_health_interview and phys_health_interview variables in the first row and plotted the
        mental_health_consequence and phys_health_consequence
        in the second row. In doing so, I am able to see all four plots at once and be able to compare their
        frequencies. From the results, we can see
        that more people prefer not to bring up a mental health issue in an interview compared to a physical issue.
        Additionally, more people believe
        that there will be negative consequences if they bring up a mental health issue compared to a physical health
        issue. The attitude towards mental
        health issues is more negative and undisclosed than physical health issues in the workplace.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h3>Visualization 10: Q3 (Do employers provide employees with enough resources regarding mental health?)</h3>
    <p>Visualization 10 - Three charts comparing whether employers provide mental health benefits,
        wellness programs, and resources to seek help for mental health issues</p>
    <div id="vis10"></div>
    <p>
        From the visualization, we can see that although some employers provide mental health benefits,
        many employers do not provide resources to learn more about mental health issues and how to seek help,
        and a majority of employers do not discuss mental health as part of an employee wellness program.
    </p>

    <p>
        Based on visualizations 10, we can see that even though employers provide mental health benefits, employers
        do not provide employees with enough resources surrounding mental health.
        To investigate the third question and to assess the resources employers provide employees,
        I first plotted a histogram of the benefits to show how many employers provide mental health benefits to
        their employees. From the results, we see that more than a third of employers provide mental health
        benefits to their employees. To continue investigating the question, I plotted the seek_help variable
        and wellness_program variables next to the benefits plot all in one row so that I am able to see all three plots
        at once and be able to compare their frequencies and resources provided by the employers. From the results,
        we can see that almost half of employers do not provide wellness programs and resouces to learn more about
        mental health issues and how to seek help. Because of this, I believe that employers do not provide employees
        with enough resouces regarding mental health, in terms of wellness programs
        and resouces to learn more about mental health issues and how to seek help.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h3>Visualization 11: Q4 (Are people more comfortable with discussing a mental health issue with their coworkers or
        supervisors?)</h3>
    <p>Visualization 11 - Comparing how comfortable people are with discussing a mental health
        issue with their coworkers or supervisor</p>
    <div id="vis11"></div>
    <p>
        From the visualization, we can see that most people people are willing to talk some of their coworkers, but
        this differs with supervisors. Surprisingly, more than double the number of people said yes to discussing a
        mental
        health issue with their supervisor than with their coworkers.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>Write-Up</h2>
    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>
        Questions are listed at the top of the page
    </p>

    <h3>Analysis Process</h3>
    <p>
        Because my dataset has 22 categorical variables out of the 27 total variables, I knew that most of my plots 
        would probably be histogram plots. For the first three visualizations, 
        I wanted to explore how the age variable was distributed and whether the age
        variable contained any data issues since the age variable is my only numerical variable that I will be using
        to investigate one of my questions. I plotted my age variable as a histogram plot to view the age distribution
        and noticed there were impossibly large age values and negative values, so I had to transform my data by
        filtering out negative age values as well as very large age values so that I could create plots that use the
        age variable later. For my next two visualizations, I wanted to explore how one of the categorical variables
        were
        distributed, so I plotted a histogram of the work_interfere variable. I noticed that there was an 'NA' category,
        which
        indicates that the respondent didn't have a mental health condition, so I had to transform my data by filtering
        out
        'NA' categories since I needed to investigate people who had a mental health condition.
    </p>

    <p>
        For visualizations 6 and 7, I hoped to investigate my first question around how mental health is impacted by
        age. To
        assess mental health, I used the work interference of a mental health condition variable and the treatment
        variable
        and plotted each variable by the age. I wanted to see how work interference differed as age increased and how
        treatment
        differed as age increased. Because of this, I binned the age so that there weren't too many ages on the plot
        and plotted it on the x-axis so that I could see how
        treatment and work interference changed as age increased. For visualization 7, I made it a line chart so that I
        could
        see the distributions for the two categories for treatment (Yes, No) easily. I did not create a line chart for
        visualization
        6 because there were 4 possible categories for the work interference variable, so creating a line chart would
        have cluttered
        up the chart, so I made it show points instead. 
    </p>

    <p>For visualizations 8 and 9, I wanted to investigate my second question around the how attitudes toward 
        mental health and physical health differ. To assess mental health and physical health, I first used the 
        mental vs physical variable, and plotted a histogram to see how people feel their employer view mental 
        health compared to physical health. Then, I continued investigating the question by using the mental_health_interview, 
        phys_health_interview, mental_health_consequence, and phys_health_consequence variables. For visualizstion 9, 
        I plotted the mental_health_interview and phys_health_interview variables in the first row and plotted the 
        mental_health_consequence and phys_health_consequence in the second row. In doing so, I was able to see all four 
        plots at once and be able to compare their frequencies across mental health and physical health. 
    </p>

    <p>
        For visualization 10, I hoped to investigate my third question regarding mental health resources employers provide
        their employees. To assess the resources employers provide employees, I first plotted a histogram of the benefits 
        to show how many employers provide mental health benefits to their employees. To continue investigating the question, 
        I plotted the seek_help variable and wellness_program variables next to the benefits plot all in one row so that I was 
        able to see all three plots at once and be able to compare their frequencies and resources provided by the employers. 

        For my last visualization, I wanted to investigate my fourth question on whether people feel more comfortable discussing
        mental health issues with their coworkers or supervisors. To investigate this question, I used the coworkers and supervisor 
        variables and created a histogram of each variable on plotted them side by side so that I could 
        compare how frequently people would discuss their mental health issue with coworkers and supervisors. 
    </p>

    <h3>Main Lessons Learned</h3>
    <p>
        The main lesson I learned when working with my dataset is that for numerical variables, it is important to make sure you 
        know the minimum and maximum value of the variable. For instance, my age variable initially had a minimum of -1726 and 
        a maximum value of 99,999,999,999. This would have really messed up my plots that used the age variable if I did not 
        transform and filter my data. The most surprising insight I gained from my dataset is that more people are willing to definitely
        talk to their supervisor about a mental health issue than to their coworkers. Before I plotted the data to investigate this area,
        I thought that very few people would want to talk to their supervisors about a mental health issue, but that is not the case.
        For my other questions, I am not too surprised by my findings regarding mental health. For instance, my plots and findings confirmed 
        what I had assumed about attitudes towards mental health and physical health; how mental health issues are brought up less frequently
        than physical health issues in the tech workplace. Fortunately though, we can see in visualization 10 that there are places where we 
        can make improvements to help people with mental health issues in the workplace. More employers could try to provide resources to their 
        employees to learn more about mental health issues and how to seek help as well as discussing mental health in employee wellness programs.

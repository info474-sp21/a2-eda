    <h1>Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>
    <h2>The Dataset</h2>
    <p>The dataset I have selected is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey/data"
            target="_blank">Mental
            Health in Tech dataset</a> from Kaggle. The dataset
        contains information about respondents, their employers, and as well as their answers to a survey on mental
        health in the tech workplace. I hope to use this dataset to try to understand
        the attitudes towards mental health in the tech workplace.</p>

    <h2>Phase 1: Understanding the Shape and Structure of the Dataset</h2>
    <p>The dataset contains 27 variables and 1,259 rows (records). Of the 27 variables, 22 of them are
        nominal/categorical. Because a majority of my variables are categorical/nominal, most of my visualizations
        will bar plots rather than scatter plots or line plots. One variable, Timestamp, is temporal. The Age and number
        of employees (no_employees)
        are the only two numerical variables. Two variables, Country and state, are geographical.
        The main variables I will be using to answer my questions are:
    <ul>
        <li>Age</li>
        <li>treatment: Respondent sought treatment for mental health condition</li>
        <li>work_interfere: If have a mental health condition, does it interfere with their work</li>
        <li>mental_vs_physical: Does respondent feel that their employer takes mental health as seriously as physical
            health</li>
        <li>mental_health_interview: Would respondent bring up a mental health issue with a potential employer in an
            interview</li>
        <li>phys_health_interview: Would respondent bring up a physical health issue with a potential employer in an
            interview</li>
        <li>mental_health_consequence: Do you think that discussing a mental health issue with your employer would have
            negative consequences</li>
        <li>phys_health_consequence: Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with your employer would have
            negative consequences?</li>
        <li>benefits: employer provides mental health benefits</li>
        <li>wellness_program: Has your employer ever discussed mental health as part of an employee wellness program
        </li>
        <li>seek_help: employer provides resources to learn more about mental health issues and how to seek help</li>
        <!-- <li>leave (how easy is it for you to take medical leave for a mental health condition)</li> -->
        <li>coworkers: Would respondent be willing to discuss a mental health issue with their coworkers</li>
        <li>supervisor: Would you be willing to discuss a mental health issue with their supervisor</li>

    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Visualizations 1 - 3: Understanding the distribution of the age variable and identifying data quality issues
    </h3>

    <p>Visualization 1 - Distribution of Age</p>
    <div id="vis1"></div>
    <p>From the visualization, we can see that in the dataset, there is one record with someone who has an age of almost
        100,000,000,000. This is not possible, so I will need
        to filter out ages that are greater than 100.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>Visualization 2 - Distribution of Age after filtering out ages over 100</p>
    <div id="vis2"></div>
    <p>From the visualization, we can see that in the dataset, there are multiple records of people who have negative
        ages.
        This is also not possible, so I will need
        to filter out ages that are both less than 0 and greater than 100.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>Visualization 3 - Distribution of Age after filtering out ages over 100 and ages less than 0</p>
    <div id="vis3"></div>
    <p>From the visualization, we can see that there is a bell curve shape, which indicates a relatively normal
        distribution of ages.
        The majority of respondents are between 20 to 40 years old, with 29 year olds being the most frequent
        respondent.</p>

    <br />
    <h3>Visualizations 4 - 5: Understanding the distribution of the work interference variable and identifying data
        quality issues</h3>
    <p>Visualization 4 - Distribution of Work Interference</p>
    <div id="vis4"></div>
    <p>From the visualization, we see that there is an 'NA' response category, which indicates that people did not have
        a mental
        health condition. I want to view how a mental health condition plays a role in work interference, so I will need
        to filter
        out the 'NA' responses.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Visualization 5 - Distribution of Work Interference after filtering out NA responses</p>
    <div id="vis5"></div>
    <p>From the visualization, we see that the most frequent response is that a mental health condition
        sometimes interferes with their work. Although the rest of the response categories are about
        half the frequency or less than the Sometimes catetgory, the frequency is somewhat similar among the
        rest of the options for Never, Rarely, and NA, with Often being the least frequent.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h2>Phase 2: Investigating the Initial Questions</h2>
    <h3>Visualizations 6 - 7: Q1 (How does age play a role in mental health?) </h3>
    <p>Visualization 6 - Work Interference of a Mental Health Condition by Age</p>
    <div id="vis6"></div>
    <p>To answer the first question, I wanted to see how age plays a role in work interference of a mental health
        condition.
        From the visualization, we clearly see that for a majority of people who are in the 20 to 40 binned age,
        a mental health condition most frequently interferes with their work sometimes, and there is a big
        gap between sometimes and the other categories (never, often , rarely). For people outside of the 20 to 40
        binned age, the gap between
        sometimes and the other categories is very tiny, which indicates that there is a difference in work interference
        of a mental health condition by age.
    </p>

    <br />
    <br />
    <p>Visualization 7 - Age Distribution of People who Did Seek Treatment and People who Did Not Seek Treatment</p>
    <div id="vis7"></div>
    <p>
        For this visualization, I wanted to see how age plays a role in whether people seek treatment for a mental
        health
        condition to help me answer the first question. The chart shows the distribution for people who did not seek
        treatment
        is distributed more to the left of the chart while the distribution for people who did seek treatment is
        distributed
        more to the right of the chart. This indicates that younger people did not seek treatment as much as older
        people.
    </p>

    <p>Based on visualizations 7 and 8, we can see that age does play a role in mental health. To assess mental health,
        I used the work interference variable (If have a mental health condition, does it interfere with their work) and
        the
        treatment variable (whether respondents sought treatment for their mental health condition). I first compared
        the
        age variable by the work interference variable and then by the treatment variable. In both cases, we see that
        there
        are differences among the work interference variable and treatment variable by age, so we can conclude that age
        plays
        a role in mental health. Younger people seek treatment for their mental health condition less frequently than
        older people.
        Additionally, for people in their 20s to 40s, a mental health condition most frequently interferes with their
        work condition
        sometimes, while for other ages, a mental health condition sometimes and often interferes with their work
        condition.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h3>Visualizations 8 - 9: Q2 (How do attitudes towards mental health differ from physical health?)</h3>
    <p>Visualization 8 - Distribution of whether respondents feel their employer takes mental health as seriously as
        physical health</p>
    <div id="vis8"></div>
    <p>
        From the visualization, we can see that most respondents don't know whether their employer
        takes mental health as seriously as physical health. Those who do believe and don't believe
        that their employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health are pretty even.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p>Visualization 9 - First row of charts compare whether respondents would bring up a mental health issue compared
        to a physical
        health issue in an interview. Second row of charts compare whether respondents believe there would be negative
        consequences if discussing
        a mental health issue compared to a physical health issue with their employer.
    </p>
    <div id="vis9"></div>
    <p>
        From the first row of charts, we can see that respondents are far less likely (more than twice less likely) to
        bring up a mental health
        issue in an interview compared to a physical health issue. From the second row of charts, we can see that far
        more people feel that there
        will not be any negative consequences of bringing up a physical health issue with their employer compared to a
        mental health issue.
    </p>

    <p>
        Based on visualizations 8 and 9, we can see that age does play a role in mental health. To assess mental health,
        I used the work interference variable (If have a mental health condition, does it interfere with their work) and
        the
        treatment variable (whether respondents sought treatment for their mental health condition). I first compared
        the
        age variable by the work interference variable and then by the treatment variable. In both cases, we see that
        there
        are differences among the work interference variable and treatment variable by age, so we can conclude that age
        plays
        a role in mental health. Younger people seek treatment for their mental health condition less frequently than
        older people.
        Additionally, for people in their 20s to 40s, a mental health condition most frequently interferes with their
        work condition
        sometimes, while for other ages, a mental health condition sometimes and often interferes with their work
        condition.
